## Part 1: Foundations & Core Methods

### 1. Linear Regression

**Overview:**  
Linear Regression is a supervised learning technique for modeling the relationship between a numeric target and one or more features by fitting a linear equation. For a single variable, the model is:

$$
\hat{y} = w_0 + w_1 x
$$

In the multivariable case, it is:

$$
\hat{y} = w_0 + w_1 x_1 + \dots + w_p x_p
$$

The method minimizes the **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** between predictions and true values, finding the best-fit line via least squares.

*Figure: A scatterplot with a red best-fit line and residuals shown as vertical lines.*

**Key Concepts:**

- **Linear Hypothesis:** The assumption of a linear relationship between features and target.
- **Parameters/Weights:**  
  - **\(w_0\) (Intercept/Bias):** The predicted value when all features are zero.  
  - **\(w_1, \dots, w_p\):** The slopes showing how each feature affects the prediction.
- **Cost Function (MSE):**
    $$\text{MSE} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \bigl(y_i-\hat{y}_i\bigr)^2$$
- **Training vs. Test Error:** Training error is measured on the training data; generalization (test) error shows performance on unseen data.
- **Outliers:** Outliers can disproportionately affect MSE, skewing the model.

**Glossary:**

- **Dependent variable (Target):** The output \(y\) the model aims to predict.
- **Independent variable (Feature):** The input \(x\) used for prediction.
- **Coefficient (Weight):** Parameter \(w_i\) indicating the effect of a feature on \(y\).
- **Intercept (Bias):** Constant \(w_0\) representing the output when all features are zero.
- **Least Squares:** Method to fit the model by minimizing the sum of squared residuals.
- **Residual (Error):** The difference \(y - \hat{y}\).
- **Underfitting:** When a model is too simple, leading to high bias.

### 2. Logistic Regression

**Overview:**  
Logistic Regression is used for binary classification. It models the probability of a positive class by applying the sigmoid function to a linear combination of features:

$$
p(x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-(w_0 + w_1 x_1 + \dots + w_p x_p)}}
$$

A probability above a chosen threshold (typically 0.5) indicates the positive class.

*Figure: The sigmoid function mapping inputs to probabilities.*

**Key Concepts:**

- **Sigmoid Function:** Transforms any real value into a value between 0 and 1.
- **Binary Classification:** Predicts one of two classes.
- **Odds Ratio:** Exponentiating coefficients gives the factor change in odds for a unit change in a feature.
- **Maximum Likelihood Estimation:** Training method to optimize the model parameters.

**Glossary:**

- **Sigmoid/Logistic Function:**  
  $$\sigma(z)=\frac{1}{1+e^{-z}}$$  
  mapping linear outputs to probabilities.
- **Odds & Log-Odds:**  
  Odds are given by  
  $$\frac{p}{1-p}$$  
  and log-odds are the natural logarithm of the odds.
- **Binary Classification:** Predicting two possible outcomes.
- **Decision Threshold:** The cutoff (often 0.5) used to classify the probability output.
- **Odds Ratio:** \(e^{w_i}\); quantifies the change in odds per unit increase in feature \(i\).
- **Multinomial Logistic Regression:** Extends logistic regression to multi-class problems.

### 3. Bias-Variance Trade-off

**Overview:**  
The Bias-Variance Trade-off describes the balance between the error from erroneous assumptions (bias) and the error from sensitivity to small data fluctuations (variance). An optimal model minimizes overall error by finding a balance between underfitting and overfitting.

$$
\text{Expected Error} = \text{Bias}^2 + \text{Variance} + \text{Irreducible Noise}
$$

![Bias–Variance Trade-off](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9f/Bias_and_variance_contributing_to_total_error.svg/1024px-Bias_and_variance_contributing_to_total_error.svg.png)  
*Figure: Illustration of bias and variance contributions to total error.*

**Glossary:**

- **Bias:** Error due to simplifying assumptions; high bias leads to underfitting.
- **Variance:** Error due to sensitivity to training data; high variance leads to overfitting.
- **Underfitting:** When a model is too simple, resulting in high bias.
- **Overfitting:** When a model is too complex, resulting in high variance.
- **Model Complexity:** Degree of flexibility in a model.
- **Regularization:** Methods to constrain a model, reducing variance.

### 4. ML Key Performance Indicators

**Overview:**  
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) are metrics used to evaluate classification and regression models. For classification, these include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, specificity, and ROC AUC. For regression, common KPIs are Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared.

**Classification Metrics:**

  |                      | Predicted Positive | Predicted Negative |
  |----------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
  | **Actual Positive**  | True Positive (TP) | False Negative (FN)|
  | **Actual Negative**  | False Positive (FP)| True Negative (TN) |

- **Accuracy:**  
  $$\text{Accuracy} = \frac{TP + TN}{TP + TN + FP + FN}$$

- **Precision:**  
  $$\text{Precision} = \frac{TP}{TP+FP}$$

- **Recall (Sensitivity):**  
  $$\text{Recall} = \frac{TP}{TP+FN}$$

- **F1 Score:**  
  $$F1 = 2 \cdot \frac{\text{Precision} \cdot \text{Recall}}{\text{Precision} + \text{Recall}}$$

- **Specificity:**  
  $$\text{Specificity} = \frac{TN}{TN+FP}$$

- **ROC AUC:** The area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve, summarizing the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity.

### 5. Validation & Cross-Validation

**Overview:**  
Validation is critical to ensure a model’s generalizability. Data is typically divided into training, validation, and test sets. Cross-validation, such as k-fold cross-validation, systematically rotates the validation set to produce a robust estimate of model performance without overfitting to a single split.

![K-Fold Cross-Validation](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b5/K-fold_cross_validation_EN.svg/1024px-K-fold_cross_validation_EN.svg.png)  
*Figure: Illustration of k-fold cross-validation where the dataset is partitioned into k subsets.*

**Glossary:**

- **Training Set:** Data used to learn model parameters.
- **Validation Set:** Data used for tuning hyperparameters and model selection.
- **Test Set:** A final hold-out set used only for final performance evaluation.
- **Hold-Out Validation:** A single split of data into training and test sets.
- **k-Fold Cross-Validation:** The data is divided into k parts and the model is trained and validated k times.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Adjusting model settings (e.g., learning rate, tree depth) based on validation performance.
- **Overfitting/Underfitting:** When validation performance indicates that the model is either too complex or too simple relative to the data.

### 6. Data Preprocessing, Feature Engineering & Encoding

**Data Cleansing:**  
Data cleansing involves detecting and correcting errors in the dataset—handling missing values, removing or correcting outliers, and standardizing formats. This step ensures the data is clean and consistent, which is crucial for building reliable models.

**Feature Creation (Engineering):**  
Feature engineering is the process of transforming raw data into informative features that improve model performance.  
- *Examples:* Creating polynomial features, extracting date components, or aggregating data within groups.  
- *Impact:* Good features can greatly improve the model’s ability to learn patterns; poor features can lead to underfitting or overfitting.

**One-Hot Encoding:**  
One-hot encoding converts categorical variables into a set of binary features, each indicating the presence (1) or absence (0) of a category. This encoding is essential for algorithms that require numerical input and avoids implying an ordinal relationship between categories.

**Train–Validation–Test Split:**  
Properly splitting the dataset ensures that model performance is evaluated on unseen data. The typical approach involves:
- **Training Set:** For fitting the model.
- **Validation Set:** For tuning hyperparameters.
- **Test Set:** For final performance evaluation.

Using cross-validation can further refine performance estimates when data is limited.
